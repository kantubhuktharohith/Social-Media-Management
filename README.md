🧠 How It Works

The app uses a simple JavaScript state object to manage:

Active navigation tab

Loading state

User profile data

Theme preference stored in localStorage

Each dashboard section is rendered dynamically by injecting HTML into the main content area based on the active tab. After each render, Lucide icons are initialized to replace icon placeholders.

Replace the mock data inside index.js (like platform stats and activity) with responses from your own API or analytics service.
